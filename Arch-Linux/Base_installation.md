# Arch Linux base installation

This is my personal routine to install Arch Linux

## Pre-configuration

```bash
loadkeys fr # Change Keyboard Layout
ping -c 4 archlinux.org # Check if I have access to the internet
timedatectl set-ntp true # Enable NTP to synchronize time within the live environment
timedatectl status # Check time status
```

## Prepare the disk

```bash
fdisk -l # Check the hard drives' name to select the one I want to install Arch Linux on
```

### Partition scheme

> EFI partition mounted on /boot --> 1G - FAT32  
> Swap partition --> 8G - SWAP  
> Root partition mounted on / --> Left free space - EXT4

### Partition the disk  

```bash
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1 # Partitioning the disk I want to install Arch on
```

> Delete current partitions ---> **o** (This deletes every partitions, use the "d" option instead if you only want to delete specific partitions)  
> Create a GPT partition table (cause I use EFI) ---> **g**
>
> Create a 1G EFI partition ---> **n** ---> **+1G** as last sector  
> Create a 8G Swap partition ---> **n** ---> **+8G** as last sector  
> Create a Root partition with the left space ---> **n**
>
> Change the first partition type to EFI ---> **t** ---> partition 1 ---> type 1  
> Change the second partition type to Linux swap ---> **t** ---> partition 2 ---> type 19  
> Change the third partition type to Linux filesystem ---> **t** ---> partition 3 ---> type 20 (this should already be done by default)
>
> Print the current partition table to review changes ---> **p**  
> Write the table to the disk ---> **w**

### Create the filesystems

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1 # Create the filesystem for the EFI partition
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p2 # Create the filesystem for the Swap partition
swapon /dev/nvme0n1p2 # Enable the Swap partition on the system
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p3 # Create the filesystem for the Root partition
```

### Mount the partitions and install the system's base

```bash
mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt # Mount the Root partition on /mnt to install the system's base on it
mkdir -p /mnt/boot # Create the /boot directory in /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot # Mount the EFI partition on /boot
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware # Install the system's base on the Root partition
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab # Generate the system's fstab
```

## Configure the system

### Chroot into the system

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt # Chroot in the new installed system's base on the root partition
```

### Configure pacman

```bash
pacman -S vim # Install my favorite editor
vim /etc/pacman.conf # Enable the "color" and "parallel downloads" options in pacman
```

> [...]  
> Color  
> [...]  
> VerbosePkgLists  
> ParallelDownloads = 10  
> [...]

### Language/Region configuration

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Paris /etc/localtime # Set up the Region/TimeZone
hwclock --systohc # Synchronize the Hardware Clock
vim /etc/locale.gen # Uncomment the local in that file (for me: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8)
locale-gen # Apply the configuration
vim /etc/locale.conf # Set the LANG variable accordingly in this file (for me: LANG=en_US.UTF-8)
vim /etc/vconsole.conf # Set the Keymap in this file (for me: KEYMAP=fr)
```

### Host configuration

```bash
vim /etc/hostname # Create the hostname file and put the hostname in it
```

> Arch-Desktop

```bash
vim /etc/hosts # Edit the hosts file and add lines from the Arch Wiki ---> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Network_configuration.
```

> 127.0.0.1        localhost  
> ::1              localhost  
> 127.0.1.1        Arch-Desktop.localdomain Arch-Desktop

### User configuration

```bash
passwd # Setup a password for the root account
useradd -m antiz # Create a "regular" user
passwd antiz # Setup a password for the user
usermod -aG wheel antiz # Add the user to the wheel group (for sudo usage)
```

### Install and configure sudo

```bash
pacman -S sudo # Install sudo
visudo # Uncomment the line that allows the wheel group members to use sudo on any command
```

> [...]  
> %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL  
> [...]

### Enable Splash Screen in mkinitcpio (optional)

This allows to show an Arch Linux logo during the loading of the initramfs by the kernel.  
This is purely aesthetic, but it also helps identifying when you're booting/loading the "regular" initramfs or the fallback one (as we'll only enable the splash screen for the "regular" initramfs).

```bash
vim /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset
```

> [...]  
> default_options="--splash /usr/share/systemd/bootctl/splash-arch.bmp" # Uncomment that line  
> [...]

### Use a more secure umask for the boot partition

This is to avoid warning with `bootctl install` in the next step.

```bash
vim /etc/fstab
```

> [...],fmask=**0077**,dmask=**0077**[...]

```bash
umount /boot
mount /boot
```

### Install and configure systemd-boot

```bash
pacman -S efibootmgr dosfstools mtools # Install packages for EFI boot. Also install "os-prober" if you wish to do a dual boot with another distro/OS
bootctl install
vim /boot/loader/loader.conf
```

> default arch.conf  
> timeout 0  
> console-mode max  
> editor no

```bash
vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
```

> title Arch Linux  
> linux /vmlinuz-linux  
> initrd /initramfs-linux.img  
> options root=UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx rw # Run 'blkid' to get the UID of your root partition

```bash
vim /boot/loader/entries/arch-fallback.conf
```

> title Arch Linux (fallback)  
> linux /vmlinuz-linux  
> initrd /initramfs-linux-fallback.img  
> options root=UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx rw # Run 'blkid' to get the UID of your root partition

```bash
systemctl enable systemd-boot-update.service
```

### Install and enable Network Manager

```bash
pacman -S networkmanager # Install "networkmanager" to manage my network connection
systemctl enable NetworkManager # Autostart NetworkManager at boot
```

## Exit the system and reboot the computer

```bash
exit # Get out of the chroot
umount -l /mnt # Umount the /mnt mounted point
reboot # Reboot the computer to boot into the fresh Arch install
```

## Log in with the "regular" user previously created and install additional useful packages

```bash
sudo pacman -S devtools man bash-completion amd-ucode pacman-contrib # Additional useful packages and drivers. Install "intel-ucode" instead of "amd-ucode" if you have an Intel CPU
```

### Install a firewall (optional)

Installing a firewall may be optional for a fresh and simple **desktop** install as Arch doesn't expose any service/ports by default.  
However, it is a supplementary security layer you might consider (even tho there's a little chance you ever need it).  
Check this link for more info/reasons to install a firewall: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/30583/why-do-we-need-a-firewall-if-no-programs-are-running-on-your-ports>

*For a server, you probably **should** install a firewall.*

```bash
sudo pacman -S firewalld # Install firewalld
sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld # Autostart firewalld at boot
```

FirewallD authorises the "ssh" and "dhcpv6-client" services by default, to make sure you won't loose access to your machine if you need those.  
But I usually prefer removing them and accept what needs to be accepted myself for a finner control.

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service="ssh" --permanent # Remove the default authorised ssh service
sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service="dhcpv6-client" --permanent # Remove the default authorised DHCPV6-client service
sudo firewall-cmd --reload # Apply changes
```

## Enable paccache (automatic cleaning of pacman cache)

The `pacman-contrib` package provides the `paccache` script which cleans the `pacman` cache by deleting all cached versions of installed and uninstalled packages, except for the most recent three.  
You can launch it manually by running `paccache -r`.

To launch `paccache` automatically on a weekly basis, enable the associated systemd timer:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now paccache.timer
```

I personally modify the associated `paccache` systemd service to also delete uninstalled packages from cache:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit paccache.service
```

> [Service]  
> ExecStart=  
> ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'paccache -ruk0 && paccache -r'

## Enable fstrim (for SSDs only - optional)

If you use SSDs, you can use `fstrim` to discard all unused blocks in the filesystem in order to improve performances.  
You can launch it manually by running `sudo fstrim -av`, but keep in mind that it is not recommended to launch it too frequently. It is commonly approved that running it once a week is a sufficient frequency for most desktop and server systems.

To launch `fstrim` automatically on a weekly basis, enable the associated systemd timer:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now fstrim.timer
```

## Enable NTP for automatic time sync

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```
